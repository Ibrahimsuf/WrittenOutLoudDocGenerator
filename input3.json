    "\u201cNo more school! No more school!\u201d I, Tengus the Amazing scream at the top of my lungs. \r\n\t\u201cShut up!\u201d Fungus, my brother said. \r\n\t\u201cYou're just jealous that I was able to get out of school earlier.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cStill shut up!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re being loud! Disruptive! Pestilential.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cYay! You said that I am persistent.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cNo! I said PEST-IL-EN-TIAL\u201d\r\n\t\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat does that mean? It seems amazing. I should be pest-il-en-tial because I\u2019m Tengus the Amazing.\r\n\tI don\u2019t like my brother. He finished school early and decided to go to another school because he\u2019s smart. I think that he is pestilential or whatever he says. To be honest, I don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s talking about. He makes me eat bananas, which is sort of like blegh. And then, he makes me throw the peels away.\r\n\t\u201cBOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d Fungus screamed. That was unprepared, though. \r\n\t\u201cMom! I want a Perry the Platypus,\u201d I scream.\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you so annoying?\u201d Fungus yells.\r\n\t\u201cTurning to\u2026 Super Annoying Mode!!!\u201d \r\n\t\u201cThis is what I mean.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms! I want mushrooms!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cBE QUIET! I\u2019m trying not to get plagiarism on my Youtube account. I mean, who might see this on my channel! To be honest, I don\u2019t want to get the AI catching me with the mushroom in the background because of the viral video!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWho cares!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cThis is exactly why your teachers complain about you when you go to the bathroom.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t have school anymore, though! School is finished already.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cBye!\u201d My brother practically screamed in my face. He stood up and walked away to his bedroom and slammed the door. \r\n\tI quickly slipped into my bedroom, went inside, and went through the small door that I had that entered his room.\r\n\t\u201cAHHH,\u201d I screamed. As I go in, there is a big black screen around me as the door shuts. I wait, but I don\u2019t hear any giggling. Or any laughing. \r\n\t\u201cFUNGUS! Get me out of here,\u201d I shout. \r\n\tNo response occurs. I turn around and try to go out the door, but the door won\u2019t budge. Guess I\u2019ll have to do it the hard way, I think. I use my claws that I brought with me to climb the big black screen, so it falls. \r\n\t\u201cYipee!\u201d I yelled as I fell on his bed. I circle back to my room and jump scare Fungus, and snuggle with my stuffies and sleep.",
    "So I thought it was gonna be a normal school day, but little did I know it would be anything but that. I woke up at around 6:00 A.M. so I could watch cocomellon. The little images always warm me in my day, the cute little boy. The episode I watched was the episode about sharing. Sharing, sharing, sharing is caring. It was a song. \r\n\u201cCan you please wake up Fungus,\u201d Mom said. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping in for a lot of time.\u201d\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I yelled. I happily skipped towards Fungus\u2019s room, grabbed a sharpie and wrote \"I'm moldy fungi!\u201d on his homework. I silently crept at Fungus\u2019s bed. \r\n\u201cRARRR,\u201d I screamed at Tengus. No sound came. He was as still as a rock.\r\nHmmm. Maybe I could draw on him. I took the sharpie again. I smoothed out his forehead and wrote, I STINK. \r\n\u201cAre you awake now, my little baby,\u201d I cooed. \r\n\u201cYes mommy pig,\u201d he said. \r\n\u201cI love you too, my little goergie pig,\u201d I cooed. \r\n\u201cI love you too mommy,\u201d he said.\r\nI smacked him in the cheek. \u201cWake up!\u201d\r\n\u201cAHHHHHHHH,\u201d he screamed.\r\nI quickly jumped off of the bed and scampered.\r\nI brushed my teeth, then dressed in my favorite undershirt.\r\n\u201cBye mom I love you, bye Fungus you smell like my feet.\u201d I said as I closed the door\r\nI peacefully walked to school. Then someone jumps in front of me.\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m walking here ya crackpot.\u201d I screamed at him, \u201cYou could have killed me.\u201d\r\n\u201cAre you Tengus the Magnificent?\u201d He asked.\r\n\u201cThats what my passport says, now get out of my way I\u2019m gonna be late for school\u201d\r\n\u201cCome with me I need you to come and save the world of the imaginary friends.\u201d He said as he opened a huge bright blue portal.\r\n\u201cIt depends, will I be back in time for recess?\u201d\r\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d \r\n\u201cThen I don't want to go\u201d\r\n\u201c But you have to save the imaginary friends!\u201d\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. No!\u2019\r\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d\r\n\u201cI made up my mind!\u201d\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d\r\n\u201cPretty please with whipped cream, sprinkles, chocolate chips, gummy worms, and all those other toppings they put on ice cream?\u201d\r\n\u201cN-O, NO!\u201d I screamed in his face, \u201c I don\u2019t want to miss recess!\u201d\r\nThen suddenly I felt a shove on my back and heard Fungus cackle \u201cBye Tengus! Have a good time with your imaginary friends!\u201d And the world went black\u2026",
    "It was all black until someone sat on me.\r\n\u201cOWWWWWW!\u201d I screamed, \r\n\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t resist it, also does my butt stink?\u201d said someone really fat, even fatter than Fungus. She was really hot (Which definitely doesn\u2019t apply just to her) and she smelled like Fungus, which isn\u2019t good.\r\nStop, I told myself, you need to save the world. Then the annoying wizard popped up and said\r\n\u201cChoose 2 people to save the world from BOB THE BOB,\u201d I looked around, I saw a muscular guy, a guy who seemed smart and a really charismatic guy.\r\nAnd then I saw her again.. The most cute (and obese) penguin was there in the audience. She was just recovering from the thing, with a little bit of odor coming from her. It looked amazing. \r\n\u201cPLEASE PICK ME!!!\u201d A rubber chicken screams. \r\n\u201cHow RUDE!\u201d I scream. But then I considered it. Maybe the enemies will be intimidated by him. I know rude people can be nice sometimes. (We don\u2019t talk about people who are like that. It may begin with f and end with s)\r\n\u201cSix seven,\u201d someone screams. It\u2019s that really muscular guy.\r\n\u201cForty-one,\u201d Someone screams back. \r\n\u201cSix-seven,\u201d someone says. \r\nThis is gonna start a flame war.\r\n\u201cDo not start a flamewar. Do orz to me. Tralalalero tralala. Bombadilo crocadilo,\u201d I scream at them again.\r\n\u201cForty-one,\u201d I said, yawning. Choosing people sounds like a terrible job, but to be honest, it\u2019s worse than it sounds.\r\n\u201cTralaleo tralala,\u201d They screamed.\r\n\u201cYou know what? I want the chicken and I want the adorable penguin.\u201d\r\n\u201cOh! That might be me,\u201d one of the other penguins said.\r\n\u201cNo! Not you! The other one over there,\u201d I yelled.\r\nTwo things came up to me. \r\n\u201cNow, it is time for you to embark and start your journey. Please everybody who\u2019s not one of the people who were selected go to your huts. Make sure that if you did end up urinating you picked up what you urinated. Make sure that you go to work at 6 a.m. tomorrow!\u201d The annoying wizard said. After everyone else left, the wizard turned to us. \u201cMake sure to pack your bags and embark on your journey.\u201d\r\nHe handed me a bundle of stuff and I started packing. Reading response note book, check. Bundle, check.Math Homework, Check. Pictures of me, THE amazing, check.\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s your name,\u201d I asked the penguin.\r\n\u201cI'm Ms. Chungus and that is rubber kickin\u2019 chicken.\u201d She replies.\r\n\u201cGreat names,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Tengus the amazing. Tengus for short.\u201d\r\n\tMs. Chungus led us down the trail and into the guest cottage. The cottage was a bright neon green with paintings of all the heroes on it. Specks of hot pink paint showed brightly on it. It looked like Fungus\u2019s younger brother pictures. It was an amazing home, and just for me. \r\n\tI ran to it, and as I barged through the door, I saw a dream place. There was a two level circular bed, and 3 lofted parts. My new home I thought. I ran up to the bedroom level, and saw not one but 3 circular rooms that I could connect. I immediately started to connect them when I heard a CREEK! I looked below, revealing another room. This is my mansion. Under my bed, there was a note that said, Wake up at 7:30 and go outside!\r\n\tI finished my stuff and went to bed, a big and fluffy pillow.",
    "BZZZZZZZ! The alarm clock screeched.\r\n\u201cTurn off,\u201d I screamed at it.\r\nI looked at the alarm clock and screeched! It was 7:30 a.m.\r\nI quickly got dressed and went outside.\r\n\u201cTime to start the mission!\u201d I screamed. \u201cThat weird wizard gave us a scroll.\u201d I silently read it.\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d screamed the rubber chicken (who in my opinion, was very rude!). \u201cWhat\u2019s the quest! We don\u2019t have all day! I have things to do. I have to have tea with a new friend in 20 years, and 6 months after that I have to eat the big banquet. \r\n\u201cThe rubber chicken speaks the truth!\u201d Said the very cute fat penguin in an adorable Australian accent. \r\n\u201cWell, say here that we have to kill a guy named BOB THE BOB who is controlling all imaginary friend guys and is torturing them by tickling them?!?! Also, he lives on the tallest mountain.\u201d\r\n\u201cWell that's just nice!\u201d the rubber chicken said. \r\n\u201cCome on, we have to get going! It's going to be a long trip.\u201d I said. \r\n\r\nOne day later\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cMy back and feet hurt! And I don\u2019t look hot anymore! We need to stop right now!\u201d Screamed the rubber chicken (who I think was named Mr. Robert kilkin\u2019 chickpen).\r\n\u201cYes. I need my beauty sleep.\u201d Said the adorable penguin (who I think was named Ms. Chengus). \r\nFinally, after what seemed like years, we got to the bottom of the mountain.\r\n\u201cWe have to climb that?! No way am I doing that!\"said the rubber chicken.\r\nThe mountain stretched miles and miles high as it seemed, but it wasn\u2019t that tall compared to mount everest. Wait a second. There\u2019s a sign! Go THERE!\r\n\u201cWe have to go that way!\u201d I exclaimed pointing in the direction of the big snow. \r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d The chicken says\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just roll there,\u201d Ms. Chungus said adorably.\r\nI ran for 2 minutes and then tripped on a ledge.\r\n\u201cI found something!\u201d I screamed.\r\n\u201cWhat? Your brain?\u201d THe chicken cried\r\n\u201cNo! An opening to the thing.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s important!\u201d\r\n took some snow off of the ledge and found an opening as Ms. Chungus rolled over to me. It was an elevator. Me, Ms. Chungus, and Rubber Kickin\u2019 chicken slipped through and waited as the elevator slowly moved up.",
    "The elevator moved extremely slowly. The thing was pure black, without any light. As the elevator slowly creeped up, we heard the screech of the elevator. The rocks pinned at the doors, and eternal crack\u201cHi! How do I defeat you!\u201d The chicken screams.\r\n\t\u201cNever tell your opponent  your weakness,\u201d Bob the Bob screamed out loud. \r\n\t\u201cOh!\u201d the chicken says with his mouth wide open. \u201cHow big are you?\u201d\r\n\t\u201c24 ant sizes,\u201d the ant said. \u201cThat\u2019s big for an ant. I hold the world record for the biggest amount of ant sizes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m magnificent.\u201d\r\n\tWhy does the chicken always get to talk first? It\u2019s like he is the king of the world in talking. At least treat Ms. Chungus with respect. I glance towards Ms. Chungus who is waiting patiently behind the chicken. Her eyes start to widen like a baseball when it is about to hit you when I look at her. \r\n\t\u201cSo, why did you decide to come here?\u201d Bob the Bob asked. \u201cMy newspaper hasn\u2019t come yet, and here, the first way to start is asking what you just asked. Wait, are you here to give me the playroom I bought on the tralaleo tralala app, or did I get a bombardilo crocodilo prize?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou're super scary.\u201d the chicken says. However, he loses his footing though when the ant comes charging into him. \r\n\t\u201cDIE!\u201d the ant screams when running. \u201cWhy does everyone always say that to me? Being 24 ant sizes isn\u2019t scary, it\u2019s just something to be proud of. I don\u2019t know about what you\u2019re proud of, but it might be the ugliest person in the world. \r\n\tPlop fell Ms. Chungus and the ant\u2019s yelling stopped. The ant had been defeated\r\n\tJust as I was about to go tell the wizard that we defeated Bob the Bob, a weird piece of paper appeared above Bob\u2019s body.\r\n\u201cOh, what now?\u201d I muttered.\r\n\u201cNow that you have defeated Bob the Bob you must come to the Gicano to beat the next opponent, Gigi the Gorilla.\u201d The scroll said as I read it.\r\n\u201cWhat, more work?!\u201d, I complained.\r\n\u201cThat is what must happen to save the Imaginary Friends kingdom.\u201d Ms.Chungus said wisely.\r\n\u201cBarf,\u201d I replied.",
    "We started the walk to the Gicano. It took a few minutes until we reached an airport called \"IMAGINARY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\u201d. Lucky for us, we had my passport in our bags because this was a 15-hour international flight to Canada. We booked first class on \u201cTHE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS AIRLINE\u201d and enjoyed the lounge. Once we boarded the plane, we took off. We finally landed 15 hours later in Westbrook Canada, then we went on a different 2 hour flight in stupid premium economy to \u201cWestbrook, Canada.\u201d We entered the place and it was filled with volcanoes and strange looking bugs and demons! It was so scary that I screamed!\r\n\t\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\u201d I screamed. \r\n\u201cHi, and welcome to Giwei City!\" A woman almost as hot as Ms. Chungus said.\r\n\t\u201cHi, we\u2019re looking for Gigi The Gangster, do you know where she is?,\u201d I asked. \r\n\u201cYes! Follow me, I will bring you to Gigi.\u201d\r\nWe boarded an SUV that the woman told us to go to and she drove. This place has a lot of things! I never thought it would look like L.A. The SUV was very nice with drinks and a TV. Half an hour later, we arrived at an alley! It was so dark inside I thought I was dead! \r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see my bootiful hair!\u201d Rubber Kickin Chicken said. \r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see my skinny body!\u201d Ms. Chungus said.\r\n\u201cWait, guys I hear footsteps!\u201d I said.\r\nSuddenly, the three of us heard a HUGE \u201cROARRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\r\n\t\t\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d We all screamed",
    "\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I said as I reached a big grey wall.\r\n\t\u201cUm, hello?\u201d I said again.\r\n\tI see a big black foot that says \u2018Gigi\u2019 on it. They say that you see your life before your eyes, but what I saw was a big black bottle of ink. I cautiously picked it up and threw it at the foot. For a moment, nothing happened, the foot kept going straight at me. Then it stopped. The foot seemed to be stopped in place, time, its life. Even if it was moving, it would\u2019ve still been slower than a snail and even slower than it takes for a glacier to move a mile. \r\n\t\u201cOwwwwwww!\u201d the thing with the big black foot said. \r\n\tI looked up, trying to comprehend what I saw. I saw this thing the size of my apartment building and all the other buildings around it. You couldn\u2019t see the face, but all I saw was the hulking black legs that supported it all. I frantically looked around, seeing how much destruction I caused. Her foot was splayed in black ink with shards of glass, and the trees were splayed with black. It was as if a black ink cloud decided to rain in the forest on a sunny day, like a cloud on your perfect dayl \r\n\t\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess up my resume for\u2026\u201d\r\n\tBang! The gigi the gangster person or I should say animal smacks her foot down and ink blobs come straight toward us. I quickly ran away behind a tree, hyperventilating while staying as still as possible. I look around, only daring to peek at what I see with one eye. I only saw a speck of white and the rest was black. How much could a 20 pound bottle of ink do? A lot.\r\n\t\u201cWhoever did this is going to pay for this!\u201d A deep bellowing voice said. \r\n\t\u201cHey! Don\u2019t you dare mess me up anymore. I already have a speck of tiny glass on my shoulder and now my yellow stuff is completely black,\u201d Rubber kickin\u2019 chicken said.\r\n\t\u201cOh! That was the best bath I have ever been able to have! Now I look like a penguin,\u201d Ms. Chungus said.\r\n\u201cYou are a penguin.\u201d\r\n\u201cI hurt a little.\u201d\t\r\n\tI can\u2019t wait any longer. \u201cSweety, are you okay?\u201d I screamed. \r\n\t\u201cYUP,\u201d Ms. Chungus said. \r\n\t\u201cUm, excuse me! Ms. Chungus is my sweetie, and no one dares mess with that,\u201d The chicken says, destroying our love moment. \r\n\tI look up to see a big black foot coming straight at me again. I look around in despair, seeing Mr. Rubber kickin chicken grooming himself and Ms. Chungus looking down. I quickly ran to Mr. Rubber kickin chicken and stepped on him, making him scream \u201csix seven!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me right now,\u201d Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken says. \r\n\t\u201cLook up!\u201d I said.\r\n\t\u201cOh! He said.\r\n\t\u201c41 is better than 6-7 now!\u201d Gigi says. And in one swift motion, Gigi comes swooping down with her hand instead of her foot at us.\r\n\tI run as quickly as possible from the hand, but the others aren\u2019t so lucky. Rubber Kickin\u2019 gets caught in the big hand as Ms. Chungus adorably runs into a tree.\r\n\t\u201cSave me!\u201d Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 chicken said.\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I scream back. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it! I cannot give you another chance because you are such a brat and I feel like I don\u2019t care about you. You know what, I think that you are stupid and you are really annoying and mean. So yeah!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cNo! Save Me, please!\u201d\r\n\tBut as I catch my breath, the other hand comes swooping down on me and Ms. Chungus.",
    "\u201cAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Me and Ms. Chungus scream. Gigi\u2019s sweaty hand tightens around us the higher we go. \r\n\u201cTis ril me m air up ow \u2018t not tiful soaojasfdkjk\u201d Mr. Rubber Kickin Chicken squeaks, which I think is \u201cThis gorilla is messing up my hair up right now and it is not beautiful and I need sephora soap.\u201d\r\nLarge balls of sweat covered our faces and more sweat covered our whole face making her face so blurry. It stung our eyes so hard he were crying to get the stuff out. I don\u2019t know that Hir makes \r\nGigi shoved us into a box with a tiny hole so we could breathe. \r\n\u201c I\u2019ll see what she\u2019s doing.\u201d I say peeking out of the hole. \u201cShe\u2019s laying on a throne eating bananas and watching tv?!\u201d\r\n\u201cGet me out of here!\u201d\r\n\u201cYeah! I want to have enough room to show my new dress!\u201d \r\n\u201cI need to fix my hair!\u201d\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d \r\n\u201cQuiet I\u2019m thinking!\u201d\r\n\u201c67!\u201d\r\n\u201cHuh?!?!\u201d\r\n\u201cI stepped on the rubber chicken.\u201d 1 hour later\u2026\r\n\u201cOkay. Guys I got a plan. So shush!\u201d...",
    "\u201cOkay Peeps. We need Ms. Chungus to fart in Gigi\u2019s face when she comes to give us food. The smell will probably be so horrible that she will run away and we will be able to escape!\u201d I say. Everyone cheered.\r\n\u201cOkay. Here she comes.\u201d I said as the top of the box lifted. \r\n\u201c NOW!!!!!!!!!\u201d Ms. Chungus did it.\r\n \u201cCome on!\u201d I scream at the rubber chicken. \r\n\u201c Okay!\u201d He screamed back. We ran and ran. Eventually, Ms. Chungus  ran up next to us. \r\n\u201cYou left me! I just barely escaped!\" She screamed.\r\n\u201cWhat else were we supposed to do?!\u201d  Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken and I screamed.\r\n\u201c I dunno.\u201d Ms. Chungus said.\r\n\u201c Come on let\u2019s - WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!\u201d I screamed. Gigi was right behind us.\r\n\u201cRUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken.\r\n\u201cUm, you forgot the farting part,\u201d I whisper.\r\n\u201cOh yeah, maybe I should add a burp on command.\u201d\r\n\u201cYep, that would be important. BUT JUST DO IT NOW PLEASE.\u201d\r\nMe and Ms. Chungus rolled as quickly as we could as we ran away from the farting chicken. Mr. Rubber Kickin Chickin appeared behind us moments after. The screaming and thrashing of Gigi scared me, and as I looked back I saw her in despair. At least her last sight will be stars. ",
    "\u201cOkay!\u201d I say as a scroll pops up. \u201c What's next?\u201d I read the scroll.\r\n\u201cWho are we going to fight?\u201d Ms. Chungus says in the cutest voice.\r\n\u201cSays here that it\u2019s a guy named Fattiest the pumpkin.\u201d\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d The rubber chicken says with an eyeroll.\r\n\u201cThis one will be so hard though. It also says here that he lives in the haunted pumpkin patch.\u201d\r\n\u201c Oh no!\u201d Says Ms Chungus.\r\n\u201cWhats wrong my dear?\u201d The rubber chicken says.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of haunted pumpkin patches!\u2019\r\n\u201c Don\u2019t fear my sweetypie! I will protect you!\u201d I say bravely.\r\n\u201c Thank you! You are truly a hero!\u201d Says Ms. Chungus. The chicken gasps.\r\n\u201c Um, let's find out where this place is.\u201d I say before Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken tackles me. \u201c It will be an hour by boat, one day by walking, three hours by car, 10 hours by horse, two hours by motorcycle,  20 minutes by plane, and one second by teleporting.\"\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d\r\nSo, they started their long walk \u2026\r\n\u201cUHHHHHGGGGGGG!\u201d the chicken rudely screams. \u201cMy legs are tired from walking.\"\r\n\u201cSo? Of course they are. They're only the size of a penny.\u201d I screamed back.\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you carry me.\u201d\r\n\u201cBecause you are fat, stinky, and annoying.\u201d\r\n\u201cWho says?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou also are just plain rude and heavy.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not obese.\u201d\r\n\u201cI never said that though.\u201d\r\n\u201cJUST CARRY ME.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the magic word?\u201d\r\n\u201cA-bracadabra.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get it on the first try, so I am not taking you!\u201d\r\n\u201cHocus pocus, you hold me.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m just going to leave without you!\u201d\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d\r\n \r\n15 minutes later\u2026\r\nA tickling sensation occurs for some reason. I look behind me and can\u2019t find rubber kickin chickin.\u2019 Why can\u2019t I walk in peace?\r\n\t\u201cOh fine I\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d\r\n\u201cMe want big instant ramen with extra noodles, meat, and spicy sauce. Actually you know what, I want extra everything.\u201d bellowed Mrs. Chungus. \u201cI mean I want to get coffee from the coffee shop. It smells good. Like also I want a red bull because it will energize me for the fight. \r\n\u201cWait a minute, is it just me or is that place across the street called The Home of the Fattiest Pumpkin.\u201d Squeaked the Rubber Kickin Chicken\r\nEveryone looked to where Rubber Kickin Chicken was now looking towards and saw a literal roof on top of a 30 foot pumpkin. \r\n\u201c Well, I think I know where we are going next.\u201d I said\r\nMe, Chicken, and Ms. Chungus slowly walked towards the pumpkin, as turnips slowly strolled in front of us. ",
    "\u201cCome on! We are going to crush this pumpkin!\u201d I screamed proudly.\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t scream or else my ears will explode!\u201d  Mr. Rubber kickin\u2019 Chicken screamed back.\r\n\t\u201cStop aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\u201d screamed Ms. Chungus.\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d I screamed as a huge army of  squashes started attacking them.\r\n\t\u201cHelp us!\u201d Ms. Chungus and I yelled.\r\n\t\u201cCome on, you think that will work?\u201d Scolded Mr. Rubber kickin\u2019 Chicken. \u201cThis is how you  do it\u2026 HELP US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Then I found an arrow.\r\n\u201cIf I miss, I\u2019ll kill myself!\u201d\r\n\u201cJust throw the dang arrow.\u201d \r\nWOOSH!  I threw the arrow. It hit one of the squashes. \r\n\u201cOne of our siblings has been shot. Call the elder. La la la la la!\u201d All the squashes sang a weird song. \r\nBOOM! BOOM!  It sounded like huge footsteps.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d I asked as the ground rumbled.\r\n\u201c Oh no! I read about this once in history class! The squashes have a leader. It's the biggest squash in history! They call him The Squash of Death.\u201d \r\n\u201cWell that's just great news!\u201d said Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chicken sarcastically.\r\n\u201cHELLO!\u201d a huge squash said in a booming voice. \u201cSO YOU ARE IDIOTS WHO KILLED MY CHILDREN. YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR CRIMES! YOU HAVE 2 CHOSES: WE WILL DROP THEM IN THE FORBIDDEN MAZE OF DEATH OR YOU CAN GET SQUASHED!\u201d \r\n\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry! We didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone!\u201d I said, frightened.\r\n\u201cWhy are you saying we?! You are the one who killed the dang squash! And if we\u2019re doing it, I guess we should get squashed.\u201d Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chickin\u2019 squealed. \r\n\u201cIT DOES NOT MATTER! I AM TIRED AND ONLY HAVE TIME TO SQUASH ONE OF THEM. WE DON\u2019T HAVE ROOM IN THE DUNGEON, SO I GUESS THE OTHER TWO COULD GET FREED. GO ON AND CHOOSE WHO\u2019S GONNA DIE. I DON\u2019T HAVE ALL  DAY!\u201d\r\n\u201cWell, we are not letting Ms. Chungus die. And she likes me to carry her so that leaves you Mr. Rubber Chicken.\u201dI said. I expected an argument and reasons why he shouldn\u2019t do it and why I should.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat?!?!\u201d Ms. Chungus and I said in amazement.\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve acted mean and rude but I\u2019m actually a really nice person. I\u2019m willing to die for you guys.\u201d he said. \r\n\u201cWell ok but\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cLet's just do it before I chicken out!\u201d \r\n\u201cOk. We have decided.\u201d\r\n\u201cGREAT. WHOEVER IT IS, STAND IN FRONT OF ME. KIDS, I SUGEST YOU LOOK AWAY.\u201d CRUNCH! \r\n\u201c Poor *sob* Mr. Rubber *sob* Kickin\u2019 Chicken!\u201d cried Ms. Chungus.\r\n\u201cThere *sob* there.\u201d, I said. \u201c Let\u2019s go and defeat that pumpkin.\u201d\r\nWe run towards the Pumpkin, but we trip. \r\n\u201cWhat is it? Ms. Chungus screams out. \r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. I turn it around to inspect it, and realize it is a squash.\r\n\u201cA squash? That\u2019s golden!\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat? How is it golden?\u201d\r\n\u201cBecause the scroll said that the tripped up squash is the key to light and gold for the hero!\u201d\r\nA rumble through the floor comes through. The sky turns purple like when you accidentally put purple tye-dye as the ground begins to shake.\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d I scream for Ms. Chungus to hear.\r\nWe run and roll as quickly as possible to the pumpkin but get stopped as the ground opens up and we fall into the ground. ",
    "For a moment, the world blacks out. Then a stomping foot comes sweeping down at me leaving the rancid smell of squash that is burning on me.\r\n\t\u201cWake up!\u201d My captor screams at me.\r\n\t\u201cHuh!?\u201d I scream as I see the wizard coming straight out at me. \u201cOh wait! You\u2019re a hero now. Come please help us. We are in dire need of help. We were sucked into a big black hole when we were going to defeat THE FATTIEST PUMPKIN. And then we lost Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chickin. Oh wait, I forgot the part where we made enemies with squashes. It was so fun. But anyways, Can you please help us? PLEASE.PLEASE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE?\u201d\r\n\tThe wizard cackled, making soft hiccups. \r\n\t\u201cUm may I excuse you, but what are you doing???\u201d Ms. Chungus exclaimed. \u201cI do not find it funny right now that you are laughing hysterically as we are supposed to save the world from these enormous creatures that don\u2019t even have half a mind. We need to be freed right now.\u201d And then she fainted.\r\n\tSuddenly, my lungs started to wheeze. I can\u2019t find anything about this that would make me wheeze, there is no dust. I look up, and realize what has happened. The cell was underground, and not enough air was being let through.\r\n\t\u201cBring the AIR out! Please!\u201d I screamed and wheezed. I looked around, hoping that I would find my captor and he would help. The cell where we were being held was dark and cramped, but no one was to be found. Except the wizard. As I turned to face him, my anger began to flare. And then I fell on the floor. \r\n\tBefore I fell asleep I heard the wizard muttering to himself \u201cAre you stupid why would I help you when I\u2019m the evil one,\u201d The wizard happily sang as he waved his magic wand around. \u201cWand, Wand, holy wand, Make there be air, make there be air, make there be co2! Open up, little dark crack, till the sunlight spills in!\u201d And the top above us opened.\r\n\t\u201cWhat did I miss this time? How long did I pass out?\u201d Ms. Chungus dreamily said.\r\n\t\u201cYou missed everything. But there\u2019s no catching up today. Oh, you passed out for exactly 67 minutes, 41 seconds, and 67 nano seconds,\u201d The wizard happily sang. He waved his wand again and chanted. \u201cWand, Wand, Holy Wand, Let there be vegetables, let there be squash, the king!\u201d\r\n\tThree squash and other vegetables came. The squash, however, were not alive. Which sort of made it even freakier than ever. The squash had bloodshot eyes, carved out frowns like they were from Halloween pumpkin carving and were left behind. Fungi seemed to have crept around them as the broccoli made its floral dents appear as fungi.\r\n\t\u201cEWW! What is the thing with prison cells and mold? They always go together!\u201d I screamed in hope they would magically sprout out febreeze. Wait, I haven\u2019t thought about my febreeze can in my bag. \r\nI sprayed some quickly around the perimeter of the room.\r\n\t\u201cWhat is that! That\u2019s not supposed to help you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The wizard commented as he slapped his hand on his head. He waved his wand and chanted, \u201cwand, wand, holy wand, please replace the clean with the dirty.\u201d\r\n\tWait a second, the wand is his only source of power. If I steal it, he will have no power. I thought.\r\n\u201cCan I please ask you a question for a moment,\u201d I asked, praying that this would work. \u201cPardon me, but can you please make some more light.\u201d\r\n\u201cOf course my dear,\u201d The wizard said as he smiled brightly into the darkness. \u201cEos, the brightness of day, come shine again,-\u201d\r\nI snatched the wand through the prison cell on the second to final word.\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? You crazy person! Give it back or else,\u2019\u2019 the wizard declared\r\n\u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make the cell ten fold bigger,\u201d I yelled out. The cell increased as the wizard stepped back.\r\n\u201cLet me tell you something. I am evil. My plan was to make you and your pork chop friends enemies of the world. They may all be kind people, but they are feared. None of them are known that much, but have formed close bonds with the people of this land. They have power over her, I don\u2019t, which is why I sent you on a quest. So basically, I am evil. Also, why did they try to kill you? Because they know you are on a quest to kill them. Yeah, so I tricked you, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! So yeah I\u2019m EVIL,\u201d The wizard screamed and then cackled. ",
    "\u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make the last spell put reversed,\u201d The wizard yelled as he waved his hand where the wand would\u2019ve been if he had it. Apparently, he already forgot that he lost his wand to me. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this spell working? WORKWORKWORK.\u201d\r\n\tI snickered to show him my hand with the wand. \r\n\t\u201cDang It! He took the trainer\u2019s wand. He can cast spells now. Well, no biggie, I have 41 more in my pocket,\u201d He murmured. His hand went in his pocket and pulled out his other wand.\r\n\tThat wizard is sort of creeping me out now. Now I need to see if he speaks the truth about himself, or if he is delulu like my brother. \u201cWand, Wand, holy wand, produce a mirror that comes from magic.\u201d\r\nPOOF! The mirror appeared. \r\n\u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make the mirror only respond to me.\u201d A silver ripple went through the mirror as it showed brightly.\r\n\u201cWhy is the mirror so dull now?\u201d Ms. Chungus, who woke up from her beauty rest asked.\r\n\u201cBecause I magicized it,\u201d I replied.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a word.\u201d\r\n\u201cSorry. But please don\u2019t sound like Fungus.\u201d\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\r\n\u201cMirror mirror on the wall, produce a mirror of truth as the color of my golden tooth,\u201d I asked. The mirror came to my hands as I pointed it at the wizard. \u201cDoes he speak the truth?\u201d\r\n\u201cWait, you have a golden tooth. That\u2019s amazing. How much do I get for it like oh my god, that is so frickin\u2019 cool. But anyway, let\u2019s see what the supposed magic mirror said, now that is \r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the mirror replied. \r\n\u201cYou tricked me! You forced me into killing gigi for no good reason and nearly made me kill the fattiest pumpkin,\u201d I wailed. He is a murderer. \u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make this man only speak the truth. You don\u2019t make me feel popular anymore. Like the song to. Wait, I\u2019m gonna sing it now. Elphie, now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI put a charm on the people of the imaginary friend's world. They now believe everything I tell them and I am their leader now. You are the second person to come here,\u201d The wizard said with his eyes faintly glowing. \r\n\u201cSTOP IT!\u201d Someone yelled from behind. \r\nI looked behind me and saw Ms. Chungus scream. \r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear a word more from you about this stuff,\u201d she yelled.\r\n\u201cWand, wand holy wand, let the squash go in the cell.\u201d The wizard murmured as he waved his wand around in the shape of a squash. ",
    "\u201cHi!\u201d Something behind my back says. \u201cI\u2019m your friend today. Do you want to play with me?\u201d\r\n\tI turn around to see what\u2019s happening while keeping an eye on the evil wizard. When I see it, I see a squash with large googly eyes. I officially will not eat squash for Thanksgiving dinner now. \u201cUm, No. Why would I want to play with you? You literally have mold coming out from the top and have googly eyes.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m your friend.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWho cares?\u201d I replied. I wave my wand and chant, \u201cMake this evil squash an EN-E-MY.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWOOR,\u201d the evil squash says. \u201cI hate you!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cTengus, what did you do? Why does he like going under your shoe or something?\u201d Ms. Chungus yelled. \tI look around and see it under my shoe. I wave my wand to cast another spell and chant, \u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make my enemy the other wizards too!\u201d\r\n\r\n\t\u201cWHAAAAAAAA,\u201d the squash screamed. This is getting creepy now, especially now. \u201cYou brought me to this life full of pain and made me have fungi on me. I hate you, you wizard. I will now attack you for making me. I HATE YOU!!!\u201d\r\n\tThe squash jumps out of the prison spell and attacks the wizard. The wizard desperately tries to fight back, but the squash keeps jumping around him. Some fungi shed around him as orange and green fall down. \r\n\t\u201cRARRRR! I will defeat my creation with my OTHER training wand!\u201d The wizard yells as he sticks the wand inside the squash. The squash immediately becomes an inanimate object and it drops to the floor. Seeds begin to sprout out of the top of it like a fountain and the goo around them was an orange as a pumpkin. The wizard kept wiping the stuff off, but eventually it became too much for him so he stopped. The wizard stood up and glared at me. \u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make this boys mouth go-\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWand, wand, holy wand, stop this spell, please at once!\u201d I yelled, waving the wand dramatically to show the wizard that I interrupted him. The wizard looked at me astonished, so I decided to give him an explanation.\u201cYou get it! I don\u2019t want to hear the spell about me or some random boy who needs his mouth to go whatever! So I interrupted you! Also, what was that squash and why did you kill it! I mean, why did you like, make a random squash appear and make it really creepy? I mean it literally. And then, why would you kill your own creation? You could\u2019ve zapped them and made them go inside a cage like you did to us!\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t zap it,\u201d the wizard replied with his eyes wide and squash goo dripping. Everyone in the room gasped at this. \r\n\t\u201cWhy? Why can\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\t\u201cWell, I might have found a bunch of trainer\u2019s wands in the forest and put them in a copying machine. A trainer wand can only cast spells if you use the wand, wand, holy wand ordeal or whatever you want to call it. I can\u2019t zap or do anything with my head?\u201d\r\n\u201cDo you know anyone who can do real life magic?\u201d \r\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a whole kingdom dedicated to magic and I used a magic spell on the people of my land to not remember or ever learn or hear about it. I don\u2019t know if the other kingdoms know about it, I only know because I studied old maps about it.\u201d\r\n\u201cWait, you tricked me? You can\u2019t do magic? WHATTTTT?\u201d Ms. Chungus suddenly interjected. \u201cWHY did you have to do that to me? My whole life as a penguinette is a lie.\u201d And then she moaned.\r\n\u201cSilence when I order,\u201d The wizard screamed. \r\nIf I make him worthless, I can kill him! Perfect!\r\n\u201cWand, wand, holy wand, make that weird man a covid-19 germ.\u201d I screamed with all my might, pointing at him. ",
    "\u201cWait, what did you just do?\u201d Ms. Chungus asked. \u201cWhere is he? Did you make him disappear?\u201d\r\n\tI looked attentively at the spot where he just stood. There was nothing left, but there was something I knew. \u201cI made him a Covid-19 Germ. Those things are very small and have no way of becoming big.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s covid?\u201d Ms. Chungus asked.\r\n\t\u201cCovid is like the big sickness that happened in my world when I was little.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cLike the big unipanda sickness?\u201d Ms. Chungus replied.\r\n\t\u201cIf a lot of them died, then yeah.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI think that we need to do something though.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked romantically.\r\n\t\u201cWe need to take off every spell that the wizard puts on our land for the people!\u201d \r\n             \u201cWell, how are we gonna do that?\u201d I asked, leaning in for a kiss.\r\n             \u201cUm, I have a boyfriend.\u201d Said Ms. Chungus, pushing me away.\r\n             \u201cBut isn\u2019t he dead?\u201d I asked curiously.\r\n             \u201cHe\u2019s still alive in here.\u201d Said Ms. Chungus, pointing at her heart. And then she began to sob uncontrollably.\r\n             \u201cThere there, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s looking down at you.\u201d I said, trying to comfort her. \u201cAfter all, your body is clearly visible from heaven.\u201d I added, which by the way was very true. \r\n             \u201cWell, the best we can do is get you home. Ms. Chungus suggested. \r\n             \u201cBut then I can\u2019t kiss you!\u201d I complained.\r\n              \u201cWell, your safety is more important than that.\u201d She said,\r\n              \u201cFine, let\u2019s go home. But first, we must tell all the imaginary friends that we are safe, rip the wizard\u2019s spell book, and then I will go home.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that\u201d, Ms. Chungus agreed.\r\n\tI then grabbed the book, ripped it into pieces, and left.\r\nSoon, we were in front of all 6,741 imaginary friends.\r\n\t\u201cOkay guys, we\u2019re safe\u201d, I explained.\r\n\t\u201cBut what about Mr. Rubber Kickin Chicken?\u201d An imaginary sea turtle asked. \r\nI then told everyone the entire story. How I tried to kiss Ms. Chungus, how Rubber Kicken Chicken risked his life for us. And how I defeated the wizard and his dumb spell book.\r\n\t\u201cOkay guys,\u201d I told everyone. \u201cAfter a long journey, I am now going back home!\u201d Everyone cheered for me! I had never felt so overjoyed! Especially with Fungus not around.\r\n\u201cBye everybody!\u201d I said, while tears rolled down my cheeks.\r\n\u201cBye! They all said happily. \r\nMs. Chungus and I then left and got instant ramen. It was now time for me to go back to my ugly, smelly  house due to Fungus growing fungus on him and refusing to ever shower.",
    "\u201cSo here you are. This is where I went plop on you for the first time. I remember seeing you and then like rolling around,\u201d Ms. Chungus says, dabbing a tear that dropped from her cheek. \u201cOh, the nostalgia of that moment.  How wonderful that was for me. I just wish Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chickin\u2019 was here for us.\u201d\r\n\u201cI have to admit something to you Ms. Chungus.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\u201cRisin' up, back on the street\r\nDid my time, took my chances\r\nJK it\u2019s just that I thought that Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chickin\u2019 was, well, annoying. I called him in my mind, \u2018Mr. Rubber Kickin\u2019 Chickin.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u201cOh well, he was a little, well, too kind to me in a sense.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut he did die, valiantly as a person who sacrificed himself for others. That was a selfless thing to do I guess.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll always remember him in my heart as you told me earlier. Remembering in my heart is something that I should work on, now that you are leaving.\u201d\r\n\u201cI have to go back home because of schoolwork and my family. But I\u2019ll always remember you. Now, can you leave so I can figure out how to use the portal back home? I'll ask for your help if I need it and when I need it.\u201d\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ms. Chungus moaned. She stood up and rolled. \r\nNow how do I go back? I looked for any sign that says, go back to Earth! I looked around, and I didn\u2019t see anything but green grass and cement. There were yellow markings there though. I paced at where the yellow markings led, leaping over weeds and ant houses as I followed my \u201cyellow paint road.\u201d\r\nAt the end of the road, there was a small plaque. I inched closer to see and tried to read it, but nothing happened. Why can\u2019t there be big signs like on highways that say, turn left for Louisville. I did like the left though because it went inside a circle. I eventually laid down to try to see what the plaque said, As I pulled my body closer and closer with my eyes squinted in slits as cold cement touched my t-shirt. My backpack bounced on my back as I tried to make sense. \r\n\u201cWay came way out,\u201d It read with nothing else except a stick figure engraved in gold. Way came, way out. How does that make sense? Wait, it means the way you came is the way you get out. But how did I get here? I walked to school and then I landed here. No, some old crackpot came and jumped in front of me. No, Fungus came behind me and pushed me into the Imaginary Friend\u2019s world thingamabob. Ms. Chungus has to push me to the floor for me to go home. \r\nI ran back to the village, screaming, \u201cMs. Chungus! Ms. Chungus! I need you urgently to get back home.\u201d \r\nMs. Chungus ran, or I should say rolled out of the house she lived in. \r\n\u201cAm I going back home with you? You know how much I want to go back with you!\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, I need you to push me as hard as you can to the ground to activate the portal! I know it sounds sort of crazy, but it\u2019s the only way I can get back home.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI would never ever push you into any place, especially the floor.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut I need it, please?\u201d I replied, giving her my best puppy eyes.\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll try. But I might roll into you.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt has to be a push.\u201d \r\n\u201cFine, Push.\u201d\r\n\t She and I race to the plaque and I stand up straight. \r\n\u201cWhat do I do again?\u201d Ms. Chungus asked.\r\n\u201cYou push me to the ground.\u201d\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\r\nShe ran behind me and crashed through as I fell to the ground, and the world went black.",
    "\u201cWHAT HAPPENED? Tell me, it better be good, because I\u2019m on episode 416.7 of my marathon. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to tell me your name, whoever you are, and if you are a green ugly monster, just please don\u2019t come in. That would be really nice of you btw,\u201d I scream, flustered that someone disrupted my screen time. \r\n\t\u201cIT\u2019S FUNGUS!\u201d The person on the other side of the room screams. \r\n\t\u201cYou are part of the ugly green monster thing, and please don\u2019t disturb me,\u201d I scream back.\r\n\t\u201cI really need to talk to you about something though,\u201d He yells. \r\n\t\u201cBut I don\u2019t really approve of that,\u201dI said a little bit louder. \u201cAnyways, Candace almost busted them just now, and I want to see the end of the episode. Oh, and bluey just stopped crying and is hugging Bingo while the baby also stopped crying.\u201d I yell.\r\n\t\u201cYou realize that I can open the door right now? You forgot to lock it.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cFine, come in.\u201d \r\n\tFungus opens the door and sits on stuffy bunny, my second favorite stuffed animal.\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on Stuffy Bunny right now, get off of him.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cFine, I\u2019ll just stand.\u201d he yells, even though I\u2019m 2 feet away from him.\r\n\tHe stands up and leans on the rail of my bed. \r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \r\n\t\u201cAbout what?\u201d\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m the one who paid the wizard and crackpot guy like, 2 cents and made him do all the trouble in getting rid of you. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work. And you got back to this world which makes me very sad because I don\u2019t really like you.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s it? You made me kill people. And how do you even know about the imaginary friend's world? It\u2019s literally another dimension and the only way to get there is to fall through a tree on park avenue on east 57th street. Did someone push you inside it.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cUm, no. I saw an advertisement on temu/walmart brothers life chat to get rid of your brother for 2 cents, and it actually worked.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cDo you buy that app on Walmart? Because I really want to get rid of you.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cUm, no. You buy it somewhere you don\u2019t \t\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Wait, never mind. I want you to answer this question instead. How did no one even realize that I was gone? Like, seriously, I was gone for like 5 days, and mom would\u2019ve noticed that by getting a text from the school on snapchat if I was absent.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cOh, that\u2019s an easy question to answer. I programmed a rotten banana with googly eyes to act like you, and since you\u2019re too stinky to look at sometimes, no one really realized. The rotten banana smell was pretty good though.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cUm, how did you do that?\u201d\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s easy, I went on capcut and instagram to figure it out.\u201d\r\n\tWhy is he so annoying like that? I\u2019m going to tell a tattle tale today and I\u2019m going to tell his mommy about what he did, and he will be fried for life. I ran to the kitchen to where my mom was cooking and stopped.\r\n\t\u201cBy golly, how could you have scared me like that. You are so scary sometimes, Tengus.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cMoooooom. Fungus sent me to the imaginary friend's world and paid a wizard 3 cents to take me away. You didn\u2019t notice that I was gone because Tengus made and programmed a rotten banana to become me and act like me. And the worst part is that he made a plan with the wizard to defeat good people and make me a bad guy. Mom, you have to believe me this time I\u2019m telling the truth!!!\u201d I say in one breath as I huff and puff at the end.\r\n\t\u201cOh Tengus, you can be so funny sometimes. But if he\u2019s right about one thing, you have been smelling like rotten bananas these days. And anyways, I\u2019m such an overprotective mother sometimes, well usually, I would\u2019ve noticed that you have been gone. And if I didn\u2019t notice, then the school would\u2019ve noticed and Dad would\u2019ve noticed and your best friend would\u2019ve too. Now, please go on and take a shower, you really should start getting in the habit of doing that more often.\u201d She replied\r\n\tI turn around and grumble and out of the corner of my eyes, I see Fungus stick his tongue out at me. Ugh, he will always be like that. He always needs to make trouble happen for me. But I\u2019m gonna get revenge. "
